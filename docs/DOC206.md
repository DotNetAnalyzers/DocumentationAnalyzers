## Cause

The documentation contains an `<autoinheritdoc>` element, but the included documentation is out-of-date with respect to
the source documentation.

## Rule description

XML documentation comments do not currently recognize the `<inheritdoc/>` element. For maximum portability,
documentation should be directly included for each documented element.

💡 The code fix for [DOC205 (Inherit Documentation)](DOC205.md) works with DOC206 to ensure documentation remains
updated and correct over time. If a future release of the compiler natively supports `<inheritdoc/>`
(dotnet/csharplang#313), the `<autoinheritdoc/>` syntax will support seamless migration to the new compiler features.
