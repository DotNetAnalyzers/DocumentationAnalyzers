## Cause

The documentation contains an unnecessary or unrecognized HTML character entity.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when documentation an unnecessarily-escaped character, making the documentation more
difficult to read than necessary. The code fix for this diagnostic also helps correct HTML character entity references
(e.g. `&rarr`), which are not supported by the XML documentation compiler.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// A city&apos;s graph from A&rarr;B.
/// </summary>
public class SomeType
{
}
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the XML- or HTML-escape sequence with the intended character.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// A city's graph from A→B.
/// </summary>
public class SomeType
{
}
```

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
#pragma warning disable DOC103 // Use Unicode characters
/// <summary>
/// A city&apos;s graph from A&rarr;B.
/// </summary>
public class SomeType
#pragma warning restore DOC103 // Use Unicode characters
{
}
```
