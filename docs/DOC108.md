## Cause

The documentation contains an empty paragraph element (`<para/>` or `<p/>`) used as a paragraph separator.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when a `<para/>` or `<p/>` is used as a paragraph separator. Rather than place an empty
paragraph element between paragraphs, the text content of paragraphs should be contained in the `<para>` element.

```csharp
/// <summary>Summary text.</summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Remarks text.
/// <para/>
/// Second paragraph of remarks, which is not placed inside the &lt;para&gt; element.
/// </remarks>
public void SomeOperation()
{
}
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, update the comment so the `<para>` element wraps the documentation text which follows
it:

```csharp
/// <summary>Summary text.</summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Remarks text.
/// <para>Second paragraph of remarks, which is now placed inside the &lt;para&gt; element.</para>
/// </remarks>
public void SomeOperation()
{
}
```

## How to suppress violations

Do not suppress violations of this rule. If the preferred documentation style does not align with the rule decription,
it is best to disable the rule.
