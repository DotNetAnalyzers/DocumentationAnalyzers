## Cause

The documentation for an `<item>` within a `<list>` did not include the required `<term>` and/or `<description>`
elements.

## Rule description

According to the C# language specification, the `<item>` element within a documentation comment must have its content
wrapped in a `<description>` element. Not all documentation processing tools support omitting the `<description>`
element, so it should be included for consistent behavior.

```csharp
/// <remarks>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>This item has text not wrapped in a description element.</item>
/// </list>
/// </remarks>
public void SomeOperation()
{
}
```

See [dotnet/csharplang#1765](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/1765) for a language proposal to natively
support lists with the `<description>` element removed.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, wrap the content of the `<item>` element in a `<description>` element.

```csharp
/// <remarks>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><description>This item has text wrapped in a description element.</description></item>
/// </list>
/// </remarks>
public void SomeOperation()
{
}
```

## How to suppress violations

This rule can be disabled rather than suppressed for projects whose documentation processing tools support `<item>`
elements which are not wrapped in a `<description>` element. In other cases, the warning can be suppressed as follows:

```csharp
#pragma warning disable DOC201 // Item should have description
/// <remarks>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>This item has text not wrapped in a description element.</item>
/// </list>
/// </remarks>
public void SomeOperation()
#pragma warning restore DOC201 // Item should have description
{
}
```
